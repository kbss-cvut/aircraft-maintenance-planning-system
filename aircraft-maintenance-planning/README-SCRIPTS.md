# Running scripts
## Running scripts in the projects
The java project contains scripts which are used for example to transform data into RDF. 
These scripts can be executed on the commandline using the run.bat command line script. For example:

> run cz.cvut.kbss.amaplas.tmpscript

will call the tmpscript class without any arguments. Note that the run command must be on the path.
