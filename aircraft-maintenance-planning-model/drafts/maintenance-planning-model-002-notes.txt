Description of columns in the table screenshots dodatečné_info_TC.png and dodatečné_info_TC-02.png :
	Each row of the table describes a task type (TC, M or S), not a specific task execution. 
	Each task is described by its code and task category "type"
	The subject of repair is located using four columns: (JA: Maintenable item??)
		- ATA code (JA: data property (added))
		- Zone - should part of the section
		- Section - section of the aircraft
		- Area - should be part of the Zone but sometimes it is the same as the Zone
		
	Each task may be composed of three steps
		- Main step - adjacent columns 
			- "Main step" - a label identifying/describing the step
			- Team - the team type which should perform the task (JA: what is the diffrent betweem team and maintenatnce task)
			- Phase - ?
			- MHrs - the typical time executing the step (JA: data property (added))
		- Access step - same as Main step but there is no Phase column
		- Final test - same as Main step
		Steps are ordered in the table as: Main Step, Access Step and Final Test
		The order of execution of the steps is: Access Step, Main Step and Final Test (JA: data property (added) )
		
	Each task may have restrictions which must be met in order to perform the task. 
The restrictions are: (JA: data property (added) (has restriction value ) )
		- El. Power - ON or OFF
		- Hyd. Power - ON or OFF
		- Jack - YES or NO
	
Questions
	What does the table rows represent?
		Each row of the table describes a task type (TC, M or S), not a specific task execution. 
		
	
	Access Step	
		questions:
			WRONG - Access to what, e.g. the area, zone or section?
			CORRECT - Does it refers to an explanation how to access the location? 
			WRONG Does it mean that access is required for the task? If so:
					WONG Is there information in the database that the access is blocked or made available?
		
		Answer:
		- Refers to a step of the task before the main step which provides access to the parts and system to be repaired. Performed before the Main step.

	Why are there two Teams?
		Answer:
		- Each step may have an assigned Team which should perform the step:
			- team Main step, team access step, team final test (step) - steps and the agents performing them
		
	MHrs?
		Answer:
		- how long the task should take.
		

	What is Final Test?
		Answer:
		- the final step of the task. Performed after the Main step.

	What is phase?
		- phase of the task, phase of the work package?
		- is there an association between phase and team?
		
	What is El. Power (Electrical Power)
		Answer:
		- specifies the Electrical power system's state required for the Main step.
		- possible values (states): ON, OFF, / (no restriction)
		
	What is Hyd. Power (Hydraulic Power)
		Answer:
		- specifies the Hydraulic power system's state required for the Main step.
		- possible values (states): ON, OFF, / (no restriction) 
		
	What is Jack?
		Answer:
		- specifies whether the Aircraft is required to be on or off the Jack for the Main step.
		- possible values (states): Yes, NO, / (no restriction)
		
	What is Min. Mech?
		Answer:
		- minimal number of mechanics for the main task
		
		
	What is Max. Mech?
		Answer:
		- restriction on the number of mechanics who can perform the task, e.g. due to spatial limitations in the area in which the task is performed.
		
	What is Skil/Scope?
		
		
	What is Note? (JA: note fot task??) (JA: note data property (added) )
		Answer:
		- text with additional information.
	
Questions - 10/28/2020:
	Do we have controlled vocabulary for the values of columns Zone, Section and Area 
	
	Can we have more information about the steps?
		- step codes and text description?
		- other steps?
	
	Are there steps for which we can specify that they turn off the Electrical or Hydraulic power or puts the Aircraft on or off the Jack?
